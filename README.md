# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based web application for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient health data. Built with Streamlit, the system utilizes a trained model to analyze key medical parameters and provide quick, reliable predictions.

## Features
- 🏥 Predicts the likelihood of CKD based on user input.
- 📊 Data preprocessing for handling categorical and numerical features.
- 🖥️ User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction.
- 📈 Trained on the CKD dataset from Kaggle for accurate classification.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for backend logic and model implementation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning model)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Streamlit** (for UI and deployment)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ckd-prediction.git
   cd ckd-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset** from Kaggle, which includes various medical parameters like blood pressure, sugar levels, and serum creatinine.

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser after running the Streamlit command.
2. Enter patient details such as age, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics.
3. Click the "Predict" button to get a CKD risk assessment.

## Model
The CKD prediction model is trained using Scikit-Learn, with feature selection and preprocessing applied to improve accuracy.
