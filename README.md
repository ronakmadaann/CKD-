# CKD-
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious health issue that requires early detection to improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. This project aims to build a predictive system using clinical and laboratory data collected over two months in India. The dataset contains 400 cases with 25 key features, including blood glucose random (bgr), red blood cell count (rc), and white blood cell count (wc). The model classifies individuals as either having CKD (‘ckd’) or not (‘notckd’), aiding doctors in early diagnosis. By analyzing data patterns, this system can support timely treatment, slow disease progression, and enhance healthcare efficiency.
